Use tidyr to make datasets tidy. Combine datasets using dplyr verbs for data joining Use regular expressions and stringr to manipulate character strings Reset levels of factor variables Communicate results of your data analysis "],["how-to-approach-the-course.html", "Chapter 3 How to approach the course", " Chapter 3 How to approach the course As you go through the lecture notes, the tasks for you to complete will be contained within the document. These tasks will constitute your homework assignment for that module of the course. Pay attention on Canvas for the due dates for each assignment. Each section will have a reading here, an in-class lecture and lab, and assignments to do. I expect that you code live with me as I show each example to understand the code and raise issues as they occur. Type each command into R yourself as I do it. Your fingers entering the commands will help you to learn them. The material in the course is meant to borrow heavily from the course textbook, R for Data Science by Wickham and Grolemund. Most of the examples are taken directly from the book. "]]
