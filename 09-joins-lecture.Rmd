# Relational Data and joins
Learning Outcomes

- Describe relational data.
- Use the correct R tidyverse function to manipulate data: 
  + `inner_join()`, 
  + `left_join()`, 
  + `right_join()`, 
  + `full_join()`, 
  + `semi_join()`, 
  + `anti_join()`.
  
### Relational Data

- Load the tidyverse

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

- Many datasets (especially those drawn from relational databases) have more than two data frames.
- These data frames are often *logically related* where rows in one data frame correspond to, or, *have a relation to*, rows in another data frame.
- Large Relational Databases are typically designed (by data engineers) to achieve some level of "normalization" 
- The goal of normalization is to design the set of tables (data frames) to capture all of the data while achieving a balance across:
  + storage size, 
  + query speed, 
  + ease of maintenance by users, and 
  + minimal delays for distributed operations with multiple users. 
- Table design strives to:
  + reduce data duplication (which increases storage and the potential for errors), and
  + enable multiple users to update their tables without interference from other users.
- A principle of normalization is to *limit tables to a single purpose.*
- As R users, we might say, a table (dataframe) describes one type of (observational or experimental) unit, with all the observations for each *variable associated with that unit and only that unit*. 
- In modern databases, you may run into tables containing blob objects such as pictures, figures, or movies
  + You may need to work with the database administrator to get only the data you need into R.

#### Example: The NYC Flights Data Set Actually has Multiple Tables 

- Consider the tables/data frames in the [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package.
    ```{r}
    library(nycflights13)
    ```
- Use the `data(package = "package-name")` to see the data sets in a package
    ```{r}
    data(package = "nycflights13")
    data(package = "babynames")
    ```

##### Each Table has One Purpose: To Describe One Type of Unit
- `airlines`: Airline names.
    ```{r}
    data("airlines")
    head(airlines)
    ```
    
- `airports`: Airport metadata
    ```{r}
    data("airports")
    head(airports)
    ```
        
- `planes`: Plane metadata.
    ```{r}
    data("planes")
    head(planes)
    ```
        
- `weather`: Hourly weather data
    ```{r}
    data("weather")
        head(weather)
    ```
        
- `flights`: Flights data
    ```{r}
    data("flights")
    head(flights)
    ```

##### These Tables are Logically Connected
- Fields in one table "relate" to fields in one or more other tables

![](./graphics/relational-nycflights.png)\ 


- For nycflights13:
  + `flights` connects to `planes` via a single variable, `tailnum`.
  + `flights` connects to `airlines` through the `carrier` variable.
  + `flights` connects to `airports` in two ways: via the `origin` and `dest` variables.
  + `flights` connects to `weather` via `origin` (the location), and `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).
    
### We Define Variables as "Keys" to Identify Rows and to Make Logical Connections Between Tables.

- Every Table should have a **Primary key** to uniquely identify (differentiate) its rows. 
  + Keys must be unique in their own table, i,e., only refer to one instance of an item. 
  + Good Data engineers create keys with no intrinsic meaning other than being a unique identifier. 
  + Some tables may use a *combined key* based on multiple columns, e.g., year, month, day together.
  + The primary key from one table may appear many times in other tables. 

- *Example*: `planes$tailnum` is a primary key for `planes` because it uniquely identifies the rows in `planes`.
- To check if you have identified the Primary Key fields, use `group_by(primary_key_fields)` and `count()` to see if there are multiple rows for any group.
- If any group has more than one row, the fields are insufficient to serve as a primary key
    ```{r}
    planes %>%
      group_by(tailnum) %>%
      count() %>%
      filter(freq > 1)
    # type is Not a Primary Key
    planes %>%
      group_by(type) %>%
      count() %>%
      filter(freq > 1)
    ```
- A primary key can also serve as a foreign key when present in another table.
- A **Foreign key** is used to identify rows in another (child) table.
- *Example*: In `flights`, `$tailnum` is a foreign key for the other table `planes` because it uniquely identifies rows in `planes`. 
- There can be multiple rows with the same foreign key in a table, e.g., `tailnum` in `flights`, so `flights$tailnum` is *not* a primary key in flights.

    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      group_by(tailnum) %>%
      count() %>%
      filter(freq > 1)
    ```

- *Example*: `weather$origin` is *part* of the primary key for `weather` (along with `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour`) 
- It is also a foreign key for `airports` (`weather$origin` is connected to `airports$faa`).
- If a table lacks a simple primary key (like `flights`), you can add one with `dplyr::mutate()` and `row_number()`.
- This new key is sometimes referred to as a *surrogate key*

    ```{r, flights_pk}
    flights %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
    nrow() - nrow(flights)
    
    flights %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day, sched_dep_time, carrier, origin, flight) %>% 
      count() %>% 
      filter(freq>1)
    
    flights %>% 
      #mutate(row = row_number(flights$flight)) %>% 
      dplyr::mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
      select(row, everything()) %>% 
      arrange(row) %>% 
      tail()
    ```


##### Exercise ([RDS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 13.3.1.2): 
- Identify the primary keys in the following data frames.
- You will probably need to install some packages (use the console) and then read the help documentation, e.g. `??Batting`.

- `Lahman::Batting`,
    ```{r, echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    ## playerID, yearID, and stint
    Lahman::Batting %>%
      count(playerID, yearID, stint) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
- `babynames::babynames`,
    
    ```{r,  echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    ## year, sex, and name
    babynames::babynames %>%
      count(year, sex, name) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    nrow(babynames::babynames)
    ```
    
- `nasaweather::atmos`,
    ```{r,  echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    ## lat, long, year, and month
    nasaweather::atmos %>%
      count(lat, long, year, month) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
- `fueleconomy::vehicles`,
    ```{r,  echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    ## id
    fueleconomy::vehicles %>%
      count(id) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
- `ggplot2::diamonds`.
    
    ```{r,  echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    ## None
    ggplot2::diamonds %>%
      distinct() %>%
      nrow() - nrow(diamonds)
    ```

### Join Functions in the dplyr Package

- Getting data from two (or more) tables requires using the primary keys and foreign keys to logically connect the tables.
- These "connections: are called **joins**
- The dplyr package has functions to connect or join tables so you can work with their data
- The dplyr package supports seven types of joins: 
  + Four types of **mutating joins**, 
  + Two types of **filtering joins**, and 
  + A **nesting join**.
- Many sources refer to the first table in a join function argument list as the `x` table or the left table or the "parent" table and second table in the argument as the `y` table or the right table or the "child" table 
- The primary key fields for the `y`/right/child table must be able to be matched to fields in the `x`/left/parent table which can serve as a foreign key.

#### Mutating Joins: Inner, Left, Right, Full
- Mutating Joins affect the rows and columns of either the `x` or `y` table
- `inner_join()`: returns *all rows from x where there are matching values in y*, and *all columns from x and y*. 
  + If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.
  + Rows that do not match are not returned
- `left_join(): `returns *all rows from x*, and *all columns from x and y*. 
  + Rows in x with no match in y are returned but will have `NA` values in the new columns. 
  + If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned.

- `right_join()`: returns *all rows from y*, and *all columns from x and y*. 
  + Rows in `y` with no match in `x` will have `NA` values in the new columns. 
    + If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned.
- `full_join()`: returns *all rows and all columns from both x and y*. 
  + Where there are not matching values, returns `NA` for the missing values.

#### Filtering Joins Filter Rows in the Left (`x`) Data Frame:
- They do not add columns; they just filter the rows of `x` based on values in `y`
- `semi_join()`: returns *all rows from x where there are matching key values in y*, keeping *just columns from x*. 
  + Filters out rows in `x` that do *not* match anything in `y`. 

- A semi-join is not the same as an inner join 
  + an inner join will return one row of `x` for each matching row of `y`, (potentially adding  multiple rows) whereas
  + a semi-join will never duplicate rows of `x`. 
  
- `anti_join()`: returns *all rows from x where there are not matching key values in y*, keeping *just columns from x*.
  + Filters out rows in x that do match anything in y (the rows with no join).

#### Nesting joins create a list column of data.frames 
- `nest_join()` return all rows and all columns from `x`. 
  + Adds a list column of tibbles where each tibble contains all the rows from `y` that match that row of `x`. 
  + hen there is no match, the list column is a 0-row tibble with the same column names and types as `y`. 
  + `nest_join()` is the most fundamental join since you can recreate the other joins from it. 
    - An `inner_join()` is a `nest_join()` plus an `tidyr::unnest()`, 
    - A `left_join()` is a `nest_join()` plus an `unnest(.drop = FALSE)`. 
    - A `semi_join()` is a `nest_join()` plus a `filter()` to ensure every element of data has at least one row, 
    - An `anti_join()` is a `nest_join()` plus a `filter()` to ensure every element of data has zero rows.
  
### Joins in Pictures

- Suppose we have the following two data frames

    ![](./graphics/join-setup.png)

    ```{r}
    x <- tribble(~key, ~val_x,
                 #---  ------
                 1,    "x1",
                 2,    "x2",
                 3,    "x3")
    y <- tribble(~key, ~val_y,
                 #---  ------
                 1,    "y1",
                 2,    "y2",
                 4,    "y3")
    ```


- A join connects rows of `x` to rows of `y`.

    ![](./graphics/join-setup2.png)\ 

- E.g. match row `1` of `x` with row `1` of `y`, and row `2` of `x` with row `2` of `y`.

    ![](./graphics/join-inner.png)\ 

#### `inner_join(x, y)` 
- This is the simplest join to add 
- Matches the rows of `x` with rows of `y` *only when their keys are equal*.

    ![](./graphics/join-inner.png)\

    ```{r, inner_join}
    inner_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```

- Keeps all rows that appear in *both* data frames.


##### Exercise: 
- Select all flights using a plane where you have some information.

    ```{r, exericse_ij, echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    inner_join(flights, planes, by = "tailnum")
    ```


#### Outer Joins: Left, Right, Full

- Outer Joins keep all rows that appear in *at least one* data frame and add columns from the other table for those rows.

    ![](./graphics/join-outer.png)\

##### `left_join(x, y)` 
- Keeps all rows of `x` and adds columns from `y`. 
- Puts in `NA` in the new `y` columns if no match.
- By far the *most common* join
- Always use a left join unless you have a good reason not to.

    ```{r}
    left_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
   
##### `right_join(x, y)` 
- Keeps all rows of `y`and adds columns from `x`. 
- Puts in `NA` in `x` columns if no match.

    ```{r}
    right_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
- Note what happens when you switch the type of join and the data frame
    ```{r}
    left_join(y, x, by = "key")
    ```
- You have flexibility to choose the order you are doing the joins and the type of joins to get the results you want from your workflow.

##### `full_join(x, y)` 
- Keeps all rows of both and adds columns from `y` to `x`.
- Puts in `NA` wherever there is no match
- Can cause a lot of extra rows and columns with `NAs` if not careful
- Only use when absolutely necessary and then only after you have selected the desired variables and filtered the desired rows.

    ```{r}
    full_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
    

##### Exercise: 
- Add the full airline names to the `flights` data frame.
    ```{r, eval = params$solutions, echo = params$solutions}
    left_join(flights, airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
      select(name, everything())
    ```
    

#### Duplicate Keys
- One would not expect to have rows with duplicate primary keys in a table from a relational database (most enforce no duplicates on the primary key fields)
- However, data from sources without rules enforcing key uniqueness often have them.
- If you have duplicate keys the `x` table, then during a left join with a `y` where there is no duplication, the rows of `y` are copied multiple times into the new `x` data frame.

    ![](./graphics/join-one-to-many.png)\
    
- This can be useful when you want to add additional information (rows) to `x` as there can be a one-to-many relationship.
- In a sense the "original" `x` key was really a foreign key with respect to the join as it did not uniquely identify the rows in `x` but was a primary key for `y`.
    
    ```{r}
    x_mult <- tribble(~key, ~val_x,
                      ##--  ------
                      1,    "x1",
                      2,    "x2",
                      2,    "x3",
                      1,    "x4")
    
    left_join(x_mult, y, by = "key")
    ```
    

- If you have duplicate keys in both (usually a mistake), then you get *every possible combination* of the values in x and y at the key values where there are duplications.

    ![](./graphics/join-many-to-many.png)\
    
    ```{r}
    y_mult <- tribble(~key, ~val_y,
                      ##--  ------
                      1,    "y1",
                      2,    "y2",
                      2,    "y3",
                      1,    "y4")
    
    left_join(x_mult, y_mult, by = "key")
    ```

##### Exercise: 
- In the previous two exercises with `flights` we had some "duplicate keys". 
- For each exercise, what were they and what was the result?
  
    ```{block, echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    `flights` had the duplicate keys both times. 
    
    1. `tailnum` was a duplicate key
    We added the plane annotation to each flight (where multiple flights used
    the same plane)  
    
    2. `carrier` was a duplicate key
    We added the carrier name (where multiple flights used the same carrier)
    in the second exercise.
    ```

#### `semi_join(x, y)` 
- *Keeps* all of the rows in `x` that have a match in `y` (but doesn't add the variables of `y` to `x`).
  
    ![](./graphics/join-semi.png)\
  
    ```{r}
    semi_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
    
#### `anti_join()` 
- *Drops* all of the rows in `x` that *do not* have a match in `y` (but doesn't add the variables of `y` to `x`).
  
    ![](./graphics/join-anti.png)\
  
    ```{r}
    anti_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
  
##### Exercise: 
- Find the 10 days of the year with the highest *median* departure delay and assign to a new data frame. 
- Join the appropriate data frames to select all flights from those 10 days.
  
    ```{r, eval = params$solutions, echo = params$solutions}
    flights %>%
      group_by(year, month, day) %>%
      summarize(med_dep = median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
      arrange(desc(med_dep)) %>%
      ungroup() %>% # Note what happens without the ungroup()
      slice(1:10) ->
      ten_worst
    
    semi_join(flights, ten_worst)
    ```
  
### Other Key Names

- If the primary and foreign keys names do not match, you need to specify the matching  names in a vector
- Example: `left_join(x, y, by = c("a" = "b"))`, where `a` is the key in `x` and `b` is the key in `y`.
- Here we join by single keys with different names in the `x` and `y` data frames
    ```{r}
    left_join(flights, airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>% 
      head()
    ```
    
- If you have multiple variables acting as a combined key, specify the `by` argument 
  as a vector.
- If they have the same name, you can drop the `=` argument
- The `,` serve as an "AND" operator

    ```{r}
    left_join(flights, weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>% 
      head()
    ```
 
- You can specify both multiple variables and with different names if necessary
- You cannot specify one key from `x` to have two different values in `y` - there is no "OR" operation; you have to do two joins.
  
##### Exercise: Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays? 
  + Select the variables of interest, 
  + Join the appropriate tables, 
  + Select the Variables of interest
  + Create a variable for the Age of the plane as of 2013
  + Assign to a new data frame
  + Use the new data frame to plot the age and apply an OLS Smoother - you may want to use `hexbin::geom_hex()` instead of geom_point
  + Run a linear model of departure delay on age and interpret the results. 
  + What about for arrival delay?

    ```{r, echo = params$solutions, eval = params$solutions}
    library(hexbin)
    flights %>%
      select(tailnum, contains("delay")) %>%
      left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
      select(year, contains("delay")) %>%
      mutate(age = 2013 - year) ->
      subflight
    
    ggplot(subflight, aes(x = age, y = dep_delay)) +
      xlab("Age of Plane") +
      ylab("Departure Delay (min)") +
      geom_hex() +
      theme_bw() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      scale_fill_continuous(low = "grey90", high = "black")
    
    lm(dep_delay ~ age, data = subflight) %>%
      summary()
    
    ## Not adjusting for anything, it seems each additional year older 
    ## for a plane is associated with a 6 second decrease in departure delay.
    
    ggplot(subflight, aes(x = age, y = arr_delay)) +
      xlab("Age of Plane") +
      ylab("Arrival Delay (min)") +
      geom_hex() +
      theme_bw() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      scale_fill_continuous(low = "grey90", high = "black")
    
    lm(arr_delay ~ age, data = subflight) %>%
      summary()
    
    ## We got a similar finding with the arrival delay
    ```
