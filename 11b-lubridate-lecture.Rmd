#Dates with `lubridate`
Learning Outcomes

- Manipulate dates and times using the `lubridate` package.

### The `lubridate` Package

- The lubridate package has many functions to simplify working with dates and times.  
- The lubridate package is **not** a part of the tidyverse so you need to load it separately.
    + Install the package if needed (using the console).
  
    ```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(lubridate)
    ```
  
#### Three main classes for date/time data

1. `Date` for just the date.  
2. `POSIXct` for both the date and the time (with Time Zone). 
    + "POSIXct" stands for "Portable Operating System Interface - Calendar Time". It is a part of a [standardized system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (based on UNIX) of representing time across many computing computing platforms.  
3. `hms` from the `hms` R package for just the time. "hms" stands for "hours, minutes, and seconds."
  
- `today()` gives the current date in the `Date` class. 
    ```{r}
    today()
    class(today())
    ```

- `now()` gives the current date-time in the `POSIXct` class.
    ```{r}
    now()
    class(now())
    ```
    
- There is no built-in R function to find the current time without the date. 
  + Use `hms::as_hms(now())` to get the current time.

    ```{r}
    hms::as_hms(now())
    class(hms::as_hms(now()))
    ```

### Parsing Dates and Times

#### Parsing Dates and Times using `readr`

- You may recall the `readr` functions `parse_date()`, `parse_datetime()`, and `parse_time()` parse a date/date-time/time from a string *with a format you specify*.

    ```{r}
    x <- parse_date("10/11/2020", format = "%m/%d/%Y")
    x
    class(x)
    
    y <- parse_datetime("10/11/2020 11:59:20", format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")
    y
    class(y)
    
    z <- parse_time("11:59:20", "%H:%M:%S")
    z
    class(z)
    ```
    
#### Parsing Dates and Times Using `lubridate`

- `lubridate` has many "helper" functions which parse dates/times more automatically. 
- The helper *function name specifies the order of the components*: year, month, day, hours, minutes, and seconds. 
- The help page for `ymd` shows multiple functions to parse **dates** with different sequences of **y**ear, **m**onth and **d**ay, 
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    help(ymd)
    ```

- Only the order of year, month, and day matters
    ```{r}
    ymd(c("2011/01-10", "2011-01/10", "20110110"))
    mdy(c("01/10/2011", "01 adsl; 10 df 2011", "January 10, 2011"))
    ```

- The help page for `mds` shows multiple functions to parse **times** 
    ```{r}
    help(ms)
    ```
    
-  Only the order of hours, minutes, and seconds matter
    ```{r}
    hms(c("10:40:10", "10 40 10"))
    ```
    
- Note: `ms()`, `hm()`, and `hms()` don't recognize "`-`" as a separator because they treat it as negative time. So use `parse_time()` here.
    ```{r}
    ms("10-10")
    ```

- The help page for `ymd_hms` shows multiple functions to parse **date-times**. 
    ```{r}
    help(ymd_hms)
    ```

##### Exercises: 

1. Parse the following date-times.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    "05/26/2004 UTC 11:11:11.444"
    "26 2004 05 UTC 11/11/11.444"
    ```
    
    ```{r,  }
    mdy_hms("05/26/2004 UTC 11:11:11.444")
    
    ## No dym_hms() function is defined, so need to use parse_datetime()
    parse_datetime("26 2004 05 UTC 11/11/11.444", "%d %Y %m UTC %H/%M/%S")
    ```
    
2. (RDS 16.2.4.3): Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse the following dates:

    ```{r}
    d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
    d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
    d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
    d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
    d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014 
    ```

    ```{r,  }
    mdy(d1)
    ymd(d2)
    dmy(d3)
    mdy(d4)
    mdy(d5)
    ```

### Creating Date-time values from individual components

- Use `make_date()` or `make_datetime()` to create dates and date-times if you have a vector of years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
  
    ```{r}
    make_date(year = 1981, month = 6, day = 25)
    make_datetime(year = 1972, month = 2, day = 22, hour = 10, min = 9, sec = 01)
    ```

- nycflights13 example:
    ```{r}
    library(nycflights13)
    data("flights")
    head(flights)
```

- You can see variables for the year, month, day, hour, and minute of the scheduled departure time
    ```{r}
      flights %>%
       mutate(datetime = make_datetime(year   = year, 
                                      month  = month, 
                                      day    = day,
                                      hour   = hour,
                                      min = minute)) ->
      flights
      select(flights, datetime)
    ```
    
- Having it in the date-time format makes it easier to plot.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(flights, aes(x = datetime)) +
      geom_freqpoly(bins = 365)
    ```

- It also makes it easier to filter by date using`as_date()` and `ymd`
    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      filter(as_date(datetime) == ymd(20130704)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = datetime)) +
      geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 600)
    ```

#### Use `as_date()` and `as_datetime()` to coerce objects to dates/times

- I used `as_date()` in the previous example. This function will *try* to coerce an object to a date. Sometimes successfully! It is particularly useful for extracting the date component of a `POSIXct` object.

- `as_datetime()` tries to coerce an object to a `POSIXct` object.  

##### Exercise: 

1. Create a date variable from the following data frame. 
- Then filter out all rows before Feb 1, 2010. 
- If you finish early, try to repeat by converting the month variable to a numeric representation of the month without using `month_num().
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
    fake <- tribble(~year, ~month, ~day, ~month_num,
                    ##----/-------/----------------
                    2018,  "Oct",  1,    10,
                    2011,  "Nov",  2,    11,
                    2019,  "Dec",  3,    12,
                    2010,  "JAN",  5,     1,
                    1999,  "MAr",  1,     3,
                    1987,  "ApR",  3,     4,
                    2020,  "maY",  2,     5,
                    2010,  "May",  4,     5)  
    ```
    
    ```{r, , eval = FALSE}
    str(fake)
    fake %>%
      mutate(date = make_date(year = year, month = month_num, day = day)) %>%
      filter(date > ymd(20100201))
    
    fake %>%
      mutate(month = str_to_sentence(month), #clean up months
             month = parse_factor(month, levels = month.abb), #convert to factor
             month = as.numeric(month), # use numeric coding of the factor level
             date = make_date(year = year, month = month, day = day)) %>%
      filter(date > ymd(20100201))
    ```
    

### `lubridate` has Functions for Getting/Setting Components of a date-time

#### Getting or extracting the component of a date-time

- `year()` extracts the year.
- `month()` extracts the month.
- `week()` extracts the week.
- `mday()` extracts the day of the month (1, 2, 3, ...).
- `wday()` extracts the day of the week (Saturday, Sunday, Monday ...).
- `yday()` extracts the day of the year (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `hour()` extracts the hour.
- `minute()` extract the minute.
- `second()` extracts the second.

    ```{r}
    ddat <- mdy_hms("01/02/1970 03:51:44")
    ddat
    year(ddat)
    month(ddat, label = TRUE)
    week(ddat)
    mday(ddat)
    wday(ddat, label = TRUE)
    yday(ddat)
    hour(ddat)
    minute(ddat)
    second(ddat)
    ```


##### Exercise: 
- Load the `wmata_ridership` data frame into R from  <https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/data/wmata_ridership.csv>. 
  + Create variables for year, month, and weekday (with labels).
  + Exclude any data from 2004. 
  + For each year and month, calculate the proportion of total monthly rides made on each day of the month (1 to 31). 
  + Make box plots of the distribution of the daily proportions of ridership vs day of the weak.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, }
    #wmata <- read_csv("./data/wmata_ridership.csv")
    wmata <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/data/wmata_ridership.csv")
    #
   glimpse(wmata)
```

    ```{r, eval = FALSE }
    wmata %>%
      mutate(year = year(Date),
             month = month(Date),
             day  = wday(Date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
      filter(year != 2004) %>%
      group_by(year, month) %>%
      mutate(prop = Total / sum(Total)) %>%
      ungroup() %>%  #view()
      ggplot(aes(x = day, y = prop)) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        theme_bw()
    ```

#### Other Uses of lubridate Functions
- You can overwrite individual components.

    ```{r}
    ddat <- mdy_hms("01/02/1970 03:51:44")
    ddat
    year(ddat) <- 1988
    ddat
    ```
    
- You can round components

    ```{r}
    ddat <- mdy_hms("01/02/1970 03:51:44")
    ddat
    round_date(ddat, unit = "year")
    ```

  
### Doing Math with Time
- Humans manipulate "clock time" with the use of policies such as [Daylight Savings Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) which creates irregularities in the "physical time".
- lubridate provides three classes of time spans to facilitate math with dates and date-times
  + **Periods**: track changes in "clock time", and *ignore irregularities* in "physical time".
  + **Durations**: track the passage of "physical time", which deviates from "clock time" when irregularities occur.
  + **Intervals**: represent specific spans of the timeline, bounded by start and end date-times.

#### Periods
- Make a period with the name of a time unit pluralized, e.g.
```{r}
p <- months(3) + days(12)
p
str(p)
```

- You can also use `as.period()` to coerce an object to a period
- Add or subtract periods to model events that happen at specific clock times, like the NYSE opening bell.

```{r}
p + months(2)
```
- You can read more about periods with
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    help("Period-class")
    ```

#### Durations

- Durations are stored as seconds, the only time unit with a consistent length.  
- Add or subtract durations to model *physical processes*, like travel or lifespan. 
- You can create durations from years with `dyears()`, from days with `ddays()`, etc...
    ```{r}
    dyears(1)
    ddays(1)
    dhours(1)
    dminutes(1)
    dseconds(1)
    ```
- You can also use `duration(quantity, units = ...)` to create a duration or `as.duration()` to coerce an object to a duration
- You can read about durations using
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    help("Duration-class")
    ```

- Example: We can find out the exact age for [UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres) using durations
    ```{r}
    d1 <- ymd(19490430)
    d2 <- today()
    str(d1)

    d2-d1
    str(d2-d1)
    as.duration(d2 - d1)
    str(as.duration(d2 - d1))
    ```
- You can add durations to date-times, but since it measures physical time, *you are always adding seconds* 
- If there is daylight savings time change you get weird results (add a day but the time is not the same as the time the previous day).
  
    ```{r}
    one_pm <- ymd_hms("2016-03-12 13:00:00", tz = "America/New_York")
    one_pm
    one_pm + ddays(1)
    ```
- Adding a `period` takes into account daylight savings.
    ```{r}
    one_pm
    one_pm + days(1)
    ```

#### Intervals
- Intervals are like durations, but they also have an associated start time. 
- Divide an interval by a duration to determine its **physical length**, 
- Divide an interval by a period to determine its **implied length** in clock time.
- Make an interval with `interval(start_date, end_date)`
  + If the start_date occurs before the end_date, the interval will be positive. Otherwise, it will be negative. 
- There are several functions for manipulating intervals or comparing them.
- You can read more about intervals with
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    help("Interval-class")
    ```
    
##### Exercise: 
- How long of a time-span is covered in the WMATA ridership dataset?
- Find as a duration and as an interval.
- Hint: Use `range()` to find the max and min
  
    ```{r,  }
    wmata <- read_csv("./data/wmata_ridership.csv")
    rng <- range(wmata$Date)
    as.duration(rng[2] - rng[1])
    as.interval(rng[2] - rng[1], start = rng[1]) / years(1)
    ```
    
### Time Zones

- Time zones are specified using the `tz` or `tzone` arguments (for example, in the call to `ymd_hms()` above).
- Time zones are specified by "content/city." For example, `"America/New_York"` and `"Europe_Paris"`
  
- You can see a complete list of over 600 time zones with `OlsonNames()`.
- But all values in a vector can only have one same time zone.
- The default time zone is `UTC` (which has no daylight savings). See [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)

- You usually don't have to worry about timezones unless you loaded them in incorrectly. 
- For example, R might think it's `UTC` even though it should be `America/New_York` and then forget daylight savings.
  
- If a date-time is labeled with the incorrect time zone, use `force_tz()`.

    ```{r}
    d1 <- ymd_hms("20140101 10:01:11")
    d1
    force_tz(d1, tzone = "America/New_York")
    ```

- If the timezone is correct, but you want to change it, use `with_tz()`.
  
    ```{r}
    with_tz(d1, tzone = "America/New_York")
    ```
