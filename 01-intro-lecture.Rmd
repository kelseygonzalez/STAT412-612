# Intro to R & Data Science

Learning Outcomes

- Understand Data Science as the context for this course  
- Understand R in the context of data science. 

## What is Data Science?

  - Coined in 2001, "*Data science* is a discipline that incorporates varying degrees of Data Engineering, Scientific Method, Math, Statistics, Advanced Computing, Visualization, Hacker mindset, and Domain Expertise." @cleveland2001data

  - "Data science, or data-driven science, combines different fields of work in statistics and computation to interpret data for decision-making purposes." @banton_2020

  - "Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data."

  - **"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"** @patil2012data

## Components of Data Science

![](images/ds-venn.jpg){width=50%}

- Statistics
- Domain Knowledge
- Computation

## Statistics

- Inferring general properties given data.
- Causal inference.
- Modeling (descriptive and predictive).
- Quantifying uncertainty.
- STAT 514, Statistical Methods, STAT 615 (Regression), STAT 627 (Machine Learning),
- Most of the STAT curriculum is applicable.

## Domain Knowledge

- Expertise in an area of application
  + e.g., biology, psychology, economics, chemistry, etc..
- Allows you to understand data in context of the area and/or decision to be made.
- Lets you ask interesting questions.
- Lets you spot problems with existing analysis pipelines.
- Various "Tracks" in the data science program.

## Computation -- This class

- Data import
- Data preparation
- Data exploration
- Data transformation
- Data visualization
- STAT 612 (R programming), STAT 613 (Data Science), most of the CS curriculum.

# Various Professions

## What makes a data scientist?

- People in diverse professions use these three skills to analyze data.
- Professions often differ by their level of expertise or interest in each skill.
- Data Science projects usually a "team activity"

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
professions <- tribble(
  ~Profession, ~Computation, ~Statistics, ~Domain,
  "Scientist", 0.2, 0.2, 1,
  "Statistician", 0.2, 1, 0.2,
  "Computer Scientist", 1, 0.2, 0.2,
  "Machine Learning Engineer", 0.8, 1.4 / 3, 0.2,
  "Data Scientist", 1.4 / 3, 1.4 / 3, 1.4 / 3
) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Profession, names_to = "Skill", values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Profession = fct_relevel(
    as_factor(Profession),
    "Scientist",
    "Statistician",
    "Computer Scientist",
    "Machine Learning Engineer",
    "Data Scientist"
  ))

professions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Skill, y = Value)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~Profession) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Skills needed per profession",
    subtitle = "notional",
    x = "", y = ""
  )
```


## Introductions

- We'll be doing group projects and you should form your groups of 2-4 people early in the semester.

- Let's take a break to introduce ourselves. Turn on your cameras and say Hi and one or two sentences about yourself  and your goals for the course. 

# The Steps of an Analysis and R

## Steps of a data analysis
 - Before you start your data analysis and R
   + Something is happening in the world
   + Someone collects data
   + Someone asks a question

 - R Time
![](images/data-science.png){width=75%}

## Tools

- Many tools exist for these steps:
- General data tools: R, Python, Julia, Matlab, STATA, SAS
- Other tools: SQL (data import), git (version control), map/reduce software
  (for big data).
- Advantages and disadvantages to each.

## R

- R is a statistical programming (or scripting) language.
- You write code (a series of functions) to perform some task.
- R can be used to perform **all** of the tasks of a data analysis.
- R is built around the idea of *packages*: like apps
  + Packages are sets of functions designed to work together to accomplish a specific set of tasks
  + There are thousands of packages and you can install any one with a simple function `install_packages()`

## Motivation for R

1. It's free and open source. 
    - You will always have access to R. 
    - Not true for other software (Matlab, STATA, SAS).

2. It's widely used with a lot of community support. 
    - If you need some special analysis, someone has often made an R package.

3. It's *relatively* easy (especially graphics and data wrangling).
    - "Evolution" driven by statisticians for local utility more than enterprise software

![](images/r_rollercoaster.png){width=75%}

4. It enables reproducible research and analysis 
    - Copying and pasting across spreadsheets can lead to mistakes - see [\textcolor{blue}{excel mistake}](https://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf) @herndon2014does
    - In R, you can essentially automate your analysis, reducing the chance for mistakes and making your analysis transparent to the wider research community as well as reproducible.
    
![](images/reproducibility_court.png){width=50%}

## What about Python??

- Python is also a very good language for data science. 
- As a more general computer language it can be used for developing broader applications.
- Computer scientists tend to prefer it because its design and syntax is more like a standard computer language. 
  + Can make it harder to learn for a non-programmer.
- Main reason to use either tool is based on the use case and your collaborators.

## Two main flavors of R Users

- There are two main flavors of R programmers: Base R users and tidyverse users.

- Base R is the default system - it's more general but not as intuitive or consistent as the tidyverse.
  
- tidyverse packages are much more convenient for the vast majority of tasks, as long as you drink the Koolaid.
  + They are not always the fastest but for many many uses and data sets they provide a convenient framework
